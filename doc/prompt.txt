🚀 Master Context: "Just Buy It" (Premium Edition)
1. Project Identity & Design Language
Goal: Build an Autonomous AI Quantitative Trading Platform. Design Inspiration: Level Financial Theme. Visual Style: "Premium Dark Fintech" / "Cyber-Glass".

Backgrounds: Deep rich navies (#020617) and slate blacks (#0f172a), NOT just flat black.

Cards: Glassmorphism is mandatory. Use bg-slate-900/50, backdrop-blur-xl, and thin border-white/10 borders.

Accents: High-contrast neon gradients.

Primary Action: Blue-to-Purple gradient (bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-violet-600).

Profit/Success: Emerald-to-Teal gradient text (text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-emerald-400 to-teal-400).

Typography: Plus Jakarta Sans or Inter. Large, bold, tracking-tight headings.

Shadows: Colored glows (shadow-lg shadow-blue-500/20).

2. Tech Stack (Hackathon Optimized)
Frontend: React (Vite) + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion (for smooth "Agent Thinking" animations) + Recharts.

Backend: FastAPI (Python).

Data Engine: DuckDB + yfinance (Bulk Download Mode).

AI: OpenAI API (GPT-4o for logic, GPT-3.5 for bulk tasks).

3. Core Architecture: The "Autonomous Loop"
Phase 0: The Data Lake (Initialization)
Action: On startup, check for sp500_history.duckdb.

If Missing: Trigger a Bulk Download of the top 50 S&P 500 stocks for the last 10 years.

Storage: Store as a localized Parquet/DuckDB file for instant querying (0ms latency).

Phase 1: The "Scout Agent" (Query Generator)
UI: User types a natural language goal: "Find me high growth tech stocks that are currently not overbought."

Logic: LLM translates this to a Pandas query against the local DB:

Sector == 'Technology'

Price < 50_Day_MA (Beaten down)

Revenue_Growth > 15% (Aggressive Growth)

Output: Returns Top 30 candidate tickers.

Phase 2: The "Evaluation Agent" (Risk & Sentiment)
Input: The 30 candidates.

Logic:

Technical Check: Filter by RSI < 70 (not overbought).

Risk Check (Proxy): Fetch ticker.news. If headlines contain ["lawsuit", "investigation", "misses estimates"], apply a "Risk Penalty".

Decision: Select the Top 10 stocks.

Phase 3: The "Portfolio Manager" (Execution)
Logic: Construct a portfolio.

Weighting: Equal Weight (10% each).

Output: A JSON structure of the "Buy Orders".

Phase 4: The "Time Machine" Backtester (The Judge Pleaser)
Trigger: "Run Backtest" button.

Algorithm:

Set Simulated_Date to 3 years ago.

Loop (Step = 6 Months):

Mask data to hide the future.

Run Scout -> Eval -> Portfolio Agents.

"Buy" the selected stocks.

Hold for 6 months.

Sell and Re-run Agents.

Result: Generate a dataset matching the Portfolio Cumulative Return vs SPY (Benchmark).

4. UI/UX Requirements (Specific)
The "Command Center" Layout
Sidebar: Glassmorphic vertical navigation on the left. Icons for "Dashboard", "Backtest", "Settings".

Hero Area: Top of dashboard. Display "Total Assets" and "Alpha Generated" using huge gradient text (e.g., text-6xl).

The "Agent Stream": A dedicated column on the right.

Design: Looks like a futuristic terminal.

Animation: When agents are working, show a "Scanning..." pulse animation.

Logs:

[SCOUT]: Querying DB for 'Undervalued Tech'... Found 24 matches.

[EVAL]: ⚠️ Rejecting INTC. Detected 'Earnings Miss' in news.

[PORTFOLIO]: Rebalancing... Buying NVDA @ $450.

The Charts
Use Recharts.

Style: Dark background, grid lines almost invisible (stroke="#334155").

Lines: Thick stroke (strokeWidth={3}), using gradient definitions (SVG defs) to make the line glow.

5. Hackathon Survival Rules
Cache Everything: If a user searches "Tech Stocks" twice, don't run the LLM again. Serve from RAM.

Fake the News: yfinance news is sparse. If news is empty, assume "Neutral Sentiment" to prevent crashes.

Progress Bar: The initial data download takes 30-60 seconds. You MUST show a beautiful, animated progress bar so the user knows the app isn't frozen.
